The algorithm is structured in the following way:
- a fuzzy set class which describes a set from fuzzy logic and whose membership function is a trapezoidal one (a
  triangle membership function can be expressed through a trapezoidal one by equalling b and c)
    - the set contains the name of the variable that is describing, the membership function and the point which describe
    the trapeze
    - based on its fields, it establishes the degree of membership to the set in question
- a fuzzy variable class which describes a fuzzy variable
    - it contains the sets which are part of the particular variable and a function which computes the degree of
    membership to each set
- a fuzzy rule class which is given the sets of two or more variables and computes a conjunction of their respective
  fuzzified values
- a fuzzy system class which describes a fuzzy system from fuzzy logic and computes the value asked by the problem given
  correct parameters (in the specified interval) by making use of the Mamdani model and weighted mean method.

Mamdani Model

In the Mamdani model the strength of a rule is given by the conjuction of the fuzzified input values of the fuzzy sets.
If two or more rules describe the same set of the result variable, the strongest (the biggest value) rule will be chosen
as representative (the values are computed using the membership function of the sets). Since the device takes only crisp
values as inputs, we have to use a defuzzifier to convert a fuzzy set to a crisp value.
The defuzzifier in the algorithm is weighted mean. Each value contributes to the weighted sum multiplied by its degree
of membership and the result is divided by the sum of the weights.
